# A02: Calculator

## Synopsis

In this assignment, you will practice your TypeScript skills through implementing the business logic functionality for a calculator web app. You will also gain familiarity with using arrow functions syntax and using higher order functions. You will also have the chance to *deploy* your website so that it is live and accessible on the internet - meaning you can share it with others. You will also be able to gain experience with Docker DevContainers and running a web application in a Node environment.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have Docker Desktop installed on your computer. If you do not have these installed, please use the following links to download and install them:
1. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
    *Make sure to have this app open before getting started!*

Also, please install the Docker DevContainers extension for VS Code. This will allow you to open this project in a Docker DevContainer! Install here: [Docker DevContainers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Getting Started

To get started on this assignment, please complete the following steps:

1. Accept the **GitHub Classroom** assignment [here]().
2. Clone the repository to your local machine. You can either do this by:
<div className="ml-3">
    * Using the CLI / Terminal: `git clone <repository-url>`
    * Using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/): Click on the green "Code" button and select "Open with GitHub Desktop".
</div>
3. Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.
4. You will now see a pop-up in the bottom right corner of your screen that says "Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file. Reopen folder to develop in a container". Click on "Reopen in Container". This will boot up a Docker container, a virtual environment that will have the correct version of Node installed for you. We will use Docker for this assignment to ensure that everyone in the class is using the same up-to-date version of Node - ensuring consistency amongst students in the class and (hopefully) to prevent compatibility issues!
    * If you do not see this pop-up, you can also open the VS Code Command Palette (Cmd + Shift + P) and search for "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container".
    * Again, you must ensure that you install the extension linked in the "Prerequisites" section above for this to work! If you did install this extension and are still having issues, try to reload VS Code.
5. The Docker container will be open once you see the green "Dev Container" icon in the bottom left corner of your VS Code window! You can now ensure that Node is installed by running `node -v` in the terminal. You should see a version number printed out.
6. Now, install the node packages required for this project by running `npm install` in the terminal. This will install all of the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
7. You can now run the project by running `npm start` in the terminal. This will start a local dev server that will host your website. Your website would then be accessible at the url `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. 
8. Navigate to this URL. You should see a calculator UI appear on your screen! Interacting with the calculator should not work at the moment - this is because you will be implementing the calculator's functionality in this assignment!

## Expectations

In this assignment, you will create a personal website that showcases yourself, your skills, courses you have taken at UNC, and any projects you have worked on! You can think of this almost like a digital resume. Personal websites are a great way to showcase the work you have done and can be a fun way to express yourself creatively. It can also be a launching pad to write blog posts or other content if you wish.

                Your website is *visually appealing* and puts in effort including styling with CSS. We recommend trying to have fun with designing here! Create something you would want to show off.
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the biggest elements to good design involves <strong><em>colors</em></strong>. Finding good matching colors can be hard - but we recommend checking out [this website](https://colorhunt.co) to find a nice color palette! This website also includes <em>hex codes</em> that can be applied. We recommend trying to set your site's background color to a lighter tone in the palette, then use darker colors to style text and other elements. If you have color questions, feel free to ask us in office hours! <strong>Please link your chosen palette in a comment in your CSS file.</strong></li>
                    <li>Another key element to design is <strong><em>typography</em></strong> - the science of fonts! [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge) is a terrific resource for both learning about fonts in general (and how to apply different types of fonts where) and finding great fonts to use. On the "Fonts" tab of the site, each font is associated with instructions on how to import this font so you can use it in your website. Press on a font, then "Get font", then "Get embed code". This should provide you with `<link>` tags and CSS classes will allow you to use custom fonts in your project.</li>
                </ul>

                We will have an entire module on design later in the course, where we will dive deeper into colors and typography. For now, feel free to experiment - and ask questions!

                <strong>Grading</strong>

                The COMP 426 staff will assign a rating for each project. The final grade will be determined by the rough average of the ratings, rounded up.

                <ul>
                    <li>**Great Effort (10)**: Great styling effort has been applied.</li>
                    <li>**Adaquate Effort (7)**: Baseline styling effort has been applied.</li>
                    <li>**Low Effort (3)**: Little to no styling effort has been applied.</li>
                </ul>

                *Note: This approach is taken to try and reduce the subjectivity of these styling points from one grader to another.*

5. Using the rubric items listed above in the **Expectations** section, begin creating the website and adding styling.

## Deployment

The final step of this project is to deploy this project to GitHub Pages! GitHub Pages allows the developer to public static websites directly from a GitHub repository to a GitHub-issued URL. This is a great (any easy) way for you to share your work and quickly get a small webpage on the internet!

Follow [this video guide]() to deploy your website to GitHub Pages. Please come into office hours if you encounter any issues!

## Submission

You will submit your final website to Gradescope. Before submitting, make sure that:

1. All of your changes have been pushed to GitHub. You will be submitting a GitHub repository link - if you do not push your changes, we may get an incomplete version of your website.
2. Your website is deployed to GitHub Pages and is accessible at the URL following the format: `https://username.github.io/comp426-username/`.
