# A01: Personal Portfolio

## Synopsis

In this assignment, you will create a static personal website / portfolio page using HTML and CSS using the techniques you have learned so far in class. You will also have the chance to *deploy* your website so that it is live and accessible on the internet - meaning you can share it with others.

## Prerequisites

This assignment, as well as all others, assumes basic proficiency with using **Git** and **GitHub**. This assignment will be completed and submited via a GitHub repository.

Git is used extensively throughout the UNC Computer Science curriculum and should have been covered in recent iterations of *COMP 211: Systems Fundamentals* and *COMP 301: Foundations of Programming*.

If you are not familiar with Git - no worries! I recommend checking out the Git related lectures and materials taught in last semester's offering of [COMP 290: Essential Tools for Computer Science](https://comp290-24f.github.io). All slides and lecture videos are posted there. If you have any questions, please see the TAs in office hours!

You should be familiar with:
* Git commits and branching.
* Git remotes, pushing to / pulling from a Git repository.
* Git merging and solving merge conflicts.

We also assume that you are up-to-date on all readings and class materials.
