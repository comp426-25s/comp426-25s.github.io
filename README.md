# COMP 426 Course Website

This repository stores the COMP 426 course website, built with Next.js and deployed using GitHub pages.

## Setup

This website uses `MDX`, a markdown - JSX hybrid, to render content pages. All of the course content is placed in the `/course` directory, and the site renders these pages.

The schedule and assignments list is managed through respective `.yaml` files located in the `/course` directory.

When adding to this site, the `/course` directory is the only one that needs to be modified.
